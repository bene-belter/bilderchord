# bilderchord
I made a little app that turns pictures into chords. It is implemented with a GUI via wxPython. You can run that GUI either by running the Bildakkord.py-script itself or by creating a stand-alone app with setup.py. 

The Bildakkord.py-script also includes an implementation of the k-means algorithm, because I was running into problems using the kmeans of sklearn together with wxPython.
